            <p>
                We decided to create such film/video as to show a preview of our Research Study regarding the 
                active coping strategies of college students in universities here in the Philippines. </p>
               
               <p> Our study is all about how we explore the perceived stress, stressors, and coping strategies employed by students studying in a problem-based learning curriculum. </p>
                <br />
            <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Synopsis</h4>
                The start of the video begins as the two main characters are shown getting ready for school. <br />It is noticeable how these two characters contrast one another. 
                The girl is the pretty, rich and social student who doesn’t really care about her grades while the boy is a diligent, hardworking and not-so rich student who treasures his grades as he believes it would help him have a brighter future.<br />
                As the video progresses, the two bonded. There came a time however, wherein the two are partners in a complex and difficult project. <br />This is where the problems start as well as the time where the two characters experience stress. Due to their contrast in personalities and lives, they both got into an argument regarding the project. 
            <br />This is because the boy realizes he is the only one working on the project even though it was supposed to be done by partners. 
            The girl soon got enough of him only caring about his grades that she furiously leaves him to the project alone.

            <br />They soon submitted the half-baked project which was immediately marked lower than the passing grade.
             Their parents was informed about this and they were not pleased. The two characters then experience the effects of too much stress which includes the following: <br />(1) Drinking and going to clubs and parties, (2) Having suicidal thoughts, (3) Breaking things intentionally, (4) Easily swayed by their emotions, (5) Getting irritated on simple things and lastly, (6) shutting out their friends. <br />Due to this being a trailer on our research study, the part on how they cope with stress isn’t included as it contradicts the meaning of a trailer. ☺
